# Global-EV-charging-station-analysis

This project analyzes global Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations, focusing on key aspects like station ratings, charger type availability, cost distribution, maintenance trends, and connector popularity.

Key Insights
1️⃣ Top-Rated Charging Stations ⭐
Identified the highest-rated charging stations based on user reviews.
Used statistical analysis to determine what factors contribute to high ratings, such as charger availability, cost, and location.

2️⃣ High-Level Charger Distribution ⚡🔋
Analyzed stations with the most advanced charging infrastructure, including Level 2 and DC fast chargers.
Found that urban areas have a higher concentration of fast chargers, while rural areas primarily rely on slower Level 1 chargers.

3️⃣ Cost Analysis 💰
Compared charging costs ($/kWh) across different station operators.
Discovered which operators charge the highest and lowest rates, helping users find the most cost-effective charging options.

4️⃣ Maintenance Trends 🛠️
Evaluated how frequently stations undergo maintenance and repairs.
Found that some operators have a higher maintenance frequency, indicating better service reliability, while others may have a higher risk of downtime.

5️⃣ Popular Connector Types 🔌
Analyzed the most widely used EV connector types, such as CHAdeMO, CCS, and Tesla Superchargers.
Observed regional preferences, with Tesla Superchargers being dominant in North America and CHAdeMO more common in Asian markets.
